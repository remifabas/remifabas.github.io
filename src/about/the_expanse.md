# The Expanse


_You know, every time you remember something your mind changes it - just a little - until your best and your worst memories are your biggest illusions._ Detective Josephus Miller, “The Expanse”

One of y all times favourites show is the expanse, and a big part of why is cause of all the characters. And Detective Josephus Miller is one of them.

Okay i'm french, and i'm really good at being french. What does that mean you ask ? It means that every time i can grumble, i will do it.
And i despise this. It's not that the thing i grumble at should not be. Most of the time is about something that it's nor working correctly or because it's unfair. But being around someone grumbling can really be toxic, especially if that person doesn't do anything about the things they're complaining about.
